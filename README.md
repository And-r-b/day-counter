# Daycounterreadme

After looking at some Scrimba sliders to learn JavaScript. It got to the point in the begnining that we had to make a Counter to count people.

After it was done, I decided to make a counter game on the web (Responsive on PC and Phone), that would count your days and if you missed a day (After not doing a action after the 24hr cooldown) you would have to try again with a soft reset that would reset the "Day Counter" to 0 but you would keep a High Score and a entry (Basically a log) of your previous day recorded.


HOW TO PLAY THE DAY COUNTER GAME:

To start:

PRESS the green "ADD DAY" to start the game. It will add 1 day under the "Day Counter" and a cooldown of 24 hours starts. After the cooldown is done you will have 24 hours to press "ADD DAY" otherwise it will count as a missed day.

Once you missed a day, It will say "You missed a day, try again!" and you wll have to press the yellow "TRY AGAIN" button in order to reset the "Day Counter" number. You will also get a "Previous Entries" number that will indicate how many days it took before you missed a day.

IF you decide that you want to reset the entire game. All you have to do is to press the gray "RESET" button. It will give you a double confirmation after each other to make sure that if you want to reset the entire game.

IF you are wondering what the buttons does in short. There is a quick note in the website about what the buttons do!.

Hope you like the game!
